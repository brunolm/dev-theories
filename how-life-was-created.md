# How life was created

It all started when God estimated that he would take 30 days to create everything, with tests, re-usable parts, but the client complained that it was too expensive and the commercial forced him to lower his estimates, so God had to reduce to 7 days.

With so little time God had to work hard, do a lot of overtime, no time to think, he just created horses as fast as he could and even created the term "Go Horse" to describe how he was feeling when he created them.

By the seventh day he had finished creating everything, and because he was so exhausted he had to take the entire day to rest.

Billion of years later, his creations, the creatures with intelligence (the AI he created), evolved and started to explore the code. They didn't understand other instances, so they sent robots to the instance Mars to explore the code. They found out that Mars was only implemented with dirt and ice, with very little unit tests.

That's when they noticed that the world is monolithic and not scalable, and wasn't built with Docker, so they can't just create another instance in Mars. To scale the system now his creations will have to build a really complex migration system to reach so far and transport resources to start implementing features on Mars.
